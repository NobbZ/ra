Ra
==

This project was a fork of [Anubis][anubis], but has been deprecated now, as I did a single change for something I used back then, but then I didn't put any further effort into this package as I hadn't any time.

The repository remains for historical reasons.

The old packages have been retired, but if you want to you can still use `0.3.0`, `0.3.1` and `0.3.2`, but do not expect any support.

The hex-package has also been transfered to the RabbitMQ team to make them able to publish a Raft package under the name "ra".
